Chicken-Pi To-Do List

* BUG: Fix exception handling from urllib3 in monitor_network.py

* Feature: Add flag to open "door" at light level (100-200 lux?)

* Feature: Add temperature control on heat lamp outlets (in addition to time);
     NOTE: This will be included in the combination of the three routines into
     a single driver.

* Feature: Combine the three routines (display_coop_values.py, outlet_timers.py,
     monitor_network.py) into a single routine for data-sharing

* Feature: Slow the write-to-file to once per minute, possibly taking the
     median of the observed values over the previous minute -- should eliminate
     spurious values from incorrect sensor readings.

Other?
