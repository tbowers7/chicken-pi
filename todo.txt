Chicken-Pi To-Do List

Add flag to open "door" at light level (100-200 lux?)

Add temperature control on heat lamp outlets (in addition to time)

Combine the three routines (display_coop_values.py, outlet_timers.py,
     monitor_network.py) into a single routine for data-sharing

Slow the write-to-file to once per minute, possibly taking the median of the
     observed values over the previous minute -- should eliminate spurious
     values from incorrect sensor readings.

Other?
