Chicken-Pi To-Do List

* BUG: Fix exception handling from urllib3 in monitor_network.py
  --- UPDATE: I think this is fixed... still testing (2/5/20)

* Feature: Add flag to open "door" at light level (100-200 lux?)

* Feature: Combine the three routines (display_coop_values.py, outlet_timers.py,
     monitor_network.py) into a single routine for data-sharing

* Feature: Add temperature control on heat lamp outlets (in addition to time);
     NOTE: This will be included in the combination of the three routines into
     a single driver.
     ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS: For each outlet, can select temperature based on
     any of the three temps (or combination).  Add radio button for each temp
     (don't care/turn on above/turn on below), along with a button for AND/OR
     with respect to the time (turn on when time AND temp / turn on when time OR
     temp).

* Feature: Slow the write-to-file to once per minute, possibly taking the
     median of the observed values over the previous minute -- should eliminate
     spurious values from incorrect sensor readings.

Other?
